## Overview
Plugins are a good way to further customise your meeting experience as plugins allow you to add your meeting space to your own website and productivity apps like ClickUp and Notion.
However, plugins can really be used anywhere that allows you to embed your meeting link and allows the page to access a camera and mic.
<Warning>Plugins will not be supported on all sites if they do not support camera, mic and screensharing permissions</Warning>
