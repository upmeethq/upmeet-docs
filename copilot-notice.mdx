## Overview
Copilot may display inaccurate or offensive information that doesn't represent UpMeet's views.

## What powers Copilot?
We use a service called Cohere (https://cohere.ai) this powers Copilot Answer whilst summaries also use this service the transcription of the call is done by us.
You can learn more about Cohere's "Responsible Use" at https://docs.cohere.ai/docs/responsible-use

### What is "Transcription"
UpMeet uses transcription for our AI Summaries and Captions features this records people who have their microphones on and we use this for the designated feature, *UpMeet never see's the transcriptions or recordings.*

## Is everyone notified if Summaries are in use?
No. We aim to add this feature in the future.

## Can I talk to someone about Copilot?
Sure thing! Email us at team@upmeet.me and we will try to get back to you as soon as we can.
