# Overview
This integration is a bit different than the others. Instead of the call being in the app it is in a widget form so you can join in one click in your Notion page.

## Step One
Copy the link below (choose extra-large or compact) and replace ```_YOUR_ID_``` with your Room ID that was sent to your when you signed up. 

#### Extra Large Widget
```html
https://upmeet.me/meet/xl-notion?id=_YOUR_ID_
```

#### Compact Widget
```html
https://upmeet.me/meet/compact-notion?id=_YOUR_ID_
```

## Step Two
1. In your Notion page press ```/``` and type "embed" and select it
2. Paste in the link you copied in Step One and paste it
3. Press "Embed Link" and you're done!
- You can also press "Join Meeting" to see if it works properly
