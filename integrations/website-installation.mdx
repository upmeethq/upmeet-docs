## Overview
In this guide we will be using the UpMeet embed code to install UpMeet to a page on your website.

### Step One
On your website create a new file (let's call it mymeeting.html or whatever you want) and copy the following code into it.

```html
<iframe src="https://upmeet.me/meet/?id=_YOUR_ID_" width="100%" height="100vh">
```

This will fill the page with your meeting room. However you can easily experiment with the height and width to format it however you want.

#### Adding the theme param (optional)
You can also add the theme param to the code you added to your website by adding a &theme=_XXX_ after your ?id=_YOUR_ID_.
You can use the preset theme's listed below or you can use a color hex code by adding &theme=000000 (with no hashtag).
- &theme=blue
- &theme=red
- &theme=green
- &theme=yellow
- &theme=orange

### Step Two
<Tip>The Room ID is automatically added when you go through onboarding when you sign up.</Tip>
In your page that you added you need to replace ```_YOUR_ID_``` with your Room ID in the embed code. You can find your Room ID in your onboarding email or when you setup UpMeet.

### Step Three
Now your ready to test your meeting room! 

Deploy the page to your website and give it a go.
