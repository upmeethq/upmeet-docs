## Overview
You can install UpMeet on an existing website or a new website, however it is usually easier to get started on an existing website that you have access to edit.

## Pre-reqs
<Info>Make sure you have your **long** meeting link</Info>

Create a new file on your website (preferably an HTML file or anything that supports an iframe), copy and paste the code below and add any other things to the webpage like your ```<head>``` tags.

## Code Example (starting from scratch)
To get the `src=""` part go to your meeting link and copy the link where your meeting space is. You do not need to fill in the `logo` , `accent` or `company` parameters however make your room more personalised.

```xml
<body>
    <script src="//upmeet.me/meet/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="//upmeet.me/upmeet.js">
    </script>
    <iframe id="upmeet-container" allow="microphone; camera; autoplay; display-capture" allowfullscreen
        src="https://app-qa.upmeet.me/meet/?id=YOUR-ID&logo=YOUR-LOGO-URL&accent=HEX-CODE&company=COMPANY-NAME"
        style="border: 0; height: 100vh; width: 100%;" />
</body>
```

The code above takes care of making your meeting look good on the page. Set the page icon and title, however you can remove `<script src="//upmeet.me/upmeet.js"></script>` if you don't want the icon and page title set.

  

### Using a site builder
You can also use your meeting link and add UpMeet to a site builder that allows you to embed another site to yours however it must support camera, microphone and screen sharing permissions.
