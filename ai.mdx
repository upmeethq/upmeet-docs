## What is Copilot?
Copilot is the UpMeet AI Assistant that helps you with questions you have and meeting summaries so you can get an overview of actionable points and key topics discussed in a meeting.


##Â How can I access it?

On Plus and above you can open Copilot by pressing the "Copilot" app in the bottom toolbar or if on mobile the "More" button and press "Ask UpMeet AI".

## What stage of development is Copilot in?
Copilot is currently in **beta**. We believe Copilot will be in beta for a year as AI is a new technology that has to be properly implemented into products to have a larger impact in the future.
