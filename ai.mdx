## What is Nova?
Nova is the UpMeet AI Assistant that helps you with questions you have and meeting summaries so you can get an overview of actionable points and key topics discussed in a meeting.

### How do I access Nova?
On Plus and above you can open Nova by pressing the "Nova" app in the bottom toolbar or if on mobile the "More" button and press "Ask UpMeet AI".

## What stage of development is Nova in?
Nova is currently in **beta**. We believe Nova will be in beta for a year as AI is a new technology that has to be properly implemented into products to have a larger impact in the future.
