<Info>We're always here to help! Contact team@upmeet.me for further help.</Info>

We hate errors but when they do happen we are ready to help! First try to look
at the errors listed below to see if they match the message your getting.

## "Device in use" / "Another app is using your camera"

It looks like the device you are using is already using your camera for another
app. Close the app that is causing your camera to be used then refresh UpMeet!
If that does not work, restart your device to see if that fixes the issue.

## "Unblock your camera and mic"

In your browser search bar, there is commonly a camera or mic, click on this and
press allow then refresh the page. If this does not work make sure your device's
camera and mic are enabled.

## "No camera or mic detected"

This means that your device is not detecting any camera or mic. This is a
hardware issue or your device does not have one at all. In the meantime use
another device or listen to others.

### ClickUp based errors
<Warning>**With the upcoming ClickUp 3.0 release there may be some bugs.**<br/> We will work on it ASAP if there is unexpected behaviour. Please email team@upmeet.me if you find any bugs regarding UpMeet in ClickUp 3.0.</Warning>

You may rarely experience unexpected behavior when using ClickUp. This could be because of many things however we suggest pressing ```Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + R``` to hard refresh the page. If that does not work, try using another browser.

### If the steps above do not work
Please contact team@upmeet.me letting us know what is happening (e.g. no audio, no video, etc.), what browser you are using and what device you are using.
