## Code: ERR_TSED
This is when the transcription service errors. Transcription is used by Captions and AI Summaries, if you get this error **turn off all features using transcription and retry. If this fails then refresh if you aren't the owner of an active breakout session.**

## Code: ERR_FATAL
This is when a error which has severly impacted your call has happened. When this happens it usually takes you to the left meeting screen however this is not always the case.
**One reason why this happens commonly is when the meeting is full/when there are too many people in a call at one time.**

## Code: ERR_NONFATAL
This is when a non-fatal error has happened. This shouldn't affect your meeting however it might be a good idea to refresh if you aren't the owner of an active breakout session.
You can contact us to get more details if needed.

## "Device in use" / "Another app is using your camera"
It looks like the device you are using is already using your camera for another
app. Close the app that is causing your camera to be used then refresh UpMeet!
If that does not work, restart your device to see if that fixes the issue.

## "Unblock your camera and mic"
In your browser search bar, there is commonly a camera or mic, click on this and
press allow then refresh the page. If this does not work make sure your device's
camera and mic are enabled.

## "No camera or mic detected"
This means that your device is not detecting any camera or mic. This is a
hardware issue or your device does not have one at all. In the meantime use
another device or listen to others.
