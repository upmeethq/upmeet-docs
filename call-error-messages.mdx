## "Device in use" / "Another app is using your camera"
It looks like the device you are using is already using your camera for another
app. Close the app that is causing your camera to be used then refresh UpMeet!
If that does not work, restart your device to see if that fixes the issue.

## "Unblock your camera and mic"
In your browser search bar, there is commonly a camera or mic, click on this and
press allow then refresh the page. If this does not work make sure your device's
camera and mic are enabled.

## "No camera or mic detected"
This means that your device is not detecting any camera or mic. This is a
hardware issue or your device does not have one at all. In the meantime use
another device or listen to others.
