## Overview
<Check>**Available on Advanced and above**</Check>

UpMeet AI can be helpful during meetings to help with a variety of things such as:
- Templates
- SOPs
- Questions
- Resources
- Anything you can prompt

### Limitations
**UpMeet AI's responses and generations do not represent UpMeet and our culture.** Responses are filtered for offensive and illegal material, however may still be shown to a user if not caught.
The AI is powered by an external provider.

**The AI may not also get everything right especially with facts and questions** so it may be worth checking the answer if needed.

### Using AI
In your meeting toolbar look for the **"AI" button** or open your sidebar and look for "AI", once you press it **type in the top input field when you're done typing press CMD + ENTER (Mac), CTRL + ENTER (Windows)** then a response will take a few moments to generate.

In the product example below you can see what UpMeet AI looks like when a response to a question is generated.
