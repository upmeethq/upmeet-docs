<Note>Please contact us if an error is significantly disrupting your experience. team@upmeet.me</Note>

## "Device in use" / "Another app is using your camera"
**It looks like the device you are using is already using your camera with another
app.** Close the app that is causing your camera to be used then refresh UpMeet.
If that does not work, restart your device to see if that fixes the issue.

## "Unblock your camera and mic"
In your browser search bar, there is commonly a camera or mic, click on this and
press allow then refresh the page. If this does not work make sure your device's
camera and mic are enabled at the system-level.

## "No camera or mic detected"
This means that your device is not detecting any camera or mic. This is a
hardware issue or your device does not have one at all. In the meantime use
another device or listen to others.

## Code: ERR_FATAL
This is when a error which has severly impacted your call has happened. When this happens it usually takes you to the left meeting screen however this is not always the case.
**One reason why this happens commonly is when the meeting is full/when there are too many people in a call at one time.**

## Code: ERR_NONFATAL
This is when a non-fatal error has happened. **This shouldn't affect your meeting however it might mean that one or more features or settings aren't working properly.** It might be a good idea to refresh if you aren't the host of an active breakout session.

## Code: ERR_TSED
This is when the transcription service errors. **This usually happens when captions are enabled.**

## Any other error with a red banner
**This is our error system telling you the issue,** when this happens we also get notified. Please contact us if the error is incorrect or is causing major issues with your experience.
