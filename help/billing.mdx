## Overview
We make billing management simple and secure. We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payment processing.

## Accessing your billing portal
1. Head over to your user dashboard at [dashboard.upmeet.me](https://dashboard.upmeet.me) and sign in. 
2. Press "Billing" in the top right hand corner, this will take you to our secure billing portal where it has your email and will send a confirmation email. 
3. Press the link in the email you'll see a screen like the first image at the start of the page. 
4. From here you can perform a range of actions.

### Cancelling your plan
Once you're in the billing portal press "Cancel Plan" and continue the flow. If you have any issues email us at team@upmeet.me **before** your next billing date or another cycle will be charged.

### Switching your plan
Currently you have to email our team at team@upmeet.me who will manually change your plan with your consent. We plan on changing this soon. You may also be subject to a check to see if the change is being requested by yourself in form of email or address.

### Accessing Invoices
In the billing portal you can access all finalised invoices. If there is anything wrong with the invoice please reach out.

## Have a different question?
We're all ears! Please email us at team@upmeet.me with any questions you have.
