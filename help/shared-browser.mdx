## Overview
<Check>**Available on Advanced and above**</Check>

Starting a shared browser allows anyone on the meeting to start a virtual browser which they can type and click on. It is a full virtual Chrome browser unique to that meeting session and room.

### Privacy
- We never see what tabs are open or what you type.
- The browser is powered by a third-party platform that is secure.
