## What is branding in UpMeet?
In UpMeet you can add your own branding to your meetings. This means that you can add your own logo, colors and more to your meeting room. This is a great way to make your meetings look more professional and to make your call feel more native.

### The colours don't look right
Oh no! This can happen when you base colour (in the url &color=XXXXXX) is too dark or light. Play around with some other colours and see if you can find one that works better. If not please reach out and we will make some changes to make sure the issue doesn't happen again.

### But why does it happen?
On signup we ask for a base colour and we use this to generate lighter and darker colours.
