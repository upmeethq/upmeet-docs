# Overview
Recordings allow you to record everyone who has an active mic and camera, also if your sharing your screen it will be included and the screenshare will be pinned.

## What quality is it?
This depends on how powerful your machine is

## I don't see the Record option
Recordings are currently only available on desktop devices and on Chrome or a Chrome based browser (e.x. Brave or Arc).
You may also not have access to recordings as you need to be on Plus and above. If you need to upgrade contact our team.

## I don't want to be recorded
Meeting Safety is a priority which is why we have made a seperate doc that explains what you can do to prevent being recorded.
You can find that doc [here](/recording-inprogress).
